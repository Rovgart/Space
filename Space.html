                The Latest Full Moon Guide: January - February 2022 From the surface of Mercury
                ,the Sun would appear more than three times as large as 
                it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would 
                be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, 
                Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – 
                that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
                Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish
                rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, 
                and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. 
                The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</p>

            <p class="info ff-lora">Venus is the second planet from the Sun in our Solar System. 
                It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is a rocky planet like Earth. Venus has a thick 
                atmosphere which is mostly composed of carbon dioxide, with thick clouds of sulfuric acid. 
                The surface of Venus is extremely hot and dry, with temperatures reaching up to 864 degrees 
                Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). The thick atmosphere also causes a greenhouse effect, 
                which makes the surface even hotter. Venus has no moons or rings. It rotates 
                slowly in the opposite direction of most planets, 
                with a day on Venus lasting longer than its year. 
                Venus is often called Earth's sister planet because of its similar size and mass.</p>
